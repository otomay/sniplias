# User warning
## ⚠️ Important Notice: 100% AI-Generated Code

I was curious about how "vibecoders" work, so I decided to test a few tools using a language I had never worked with before: **Rust**.

I was already familiar with Ratatui, since I use several TUIs in my daily workflow. One thing I've always wanted was a simple alias and snippet manager.

For aliases, I wasn't using anything special; I would just edit my shell's source file directly.
For snippets, I was using [pet](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet) (which I still recommend if you're concerned about AI-generated projects).

That said, I'm not even sure "snippet" is the best term here. In practice, these are just commands meant to be executed in the terminal 🙂

The issue for me was that [pet](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet) isn't as simple to use as I would like. That's what motivated me to start this project.

### Why?

See above.

---

### Tools I Used

* [opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) (pretty nice)
* [oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode) (just wow, the free models are awesome (I only used free models in this project))
* [vibe-kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban) (kinda laggy/buggy in my machine, I only used to fix a single issue)
* [picoclaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw) (probably just inserted a dozen lines, not extensivelly used)
* [aicommits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits) (used a few times, but ended rewriting the history -- stil gona use it tho)

---

### Final Considerations

Although this was fun to build, I did **not** review or thoroughly check the code.

I do **not** recommend using projects that are 100% AI-generated for anything important, as they may carry serious security risks.
(Yes, this project only manages local text, but even so, caution is always a good idea.)
